# Dummy API to test rocket

### Exp thus far

- docs are outdated, so looking for a way to customize the port took a while
- unrelated to Rocket, but rust analyzer blocks a resource so u wont be able to build till it finishes.

- you can easily split routes depending on ur needs, same with error catchers
  - error catchers are like a middle ware that handles status code errors, i would think
